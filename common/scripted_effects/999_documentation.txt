# This file exists to explain my file naming scheme
# Both for myself as well as anyone who's trying to understand what I was doing
# If you're the latter, hit me with a comment on steam. I hid a lot of easter eggs in the mod files, so it'd be cool if someone found them.

# The first number is the category: 
# 0 for the Presets
# 1 for Small Arms and Arty
# 2 for Tanks
# 3 for Planes
# 4 for Boats
# 9 for Other/Debug

# The second number is for the mod, in no particular order, but 0 is vanilla

# The third is for the order they appear in the decisions
