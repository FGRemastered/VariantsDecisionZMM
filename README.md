# VariantsDecisionZMM
A mod that gives immediate access to the best possible variant of armor, planes and ships.

## Compatibility
Works with MtG, LaR and NSB on or off

Works with Endsieg, Kaiserreich (fixed), Road to 56 (fixed) and Add Technologies. (If it uses the vanilla equipment names. it's compatible.)

## FAQ
> Is this balanced?

Heck, no!

> Is it fun, seeing those heavy tanks get overrun by your lights?

Absolutely.

Feel free to download the files and tweak things yourself.

### Warning: 

Since this mod supports a lot of other mods with their own tech trees, the game will throw an error for every thing it does not recognise. Until I find out how to suppress errors under certain conditions, the log will be fairly cluttered. I'm sorry for that.
